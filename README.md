# dotfiles

This repo contains my dotfiles and it contains an `install.sh` script that:

- installs packages and apps that I regularly use (1Password, Tmux, VS Code, etc)
- symlinks my actual dotfiles to the right locations
- sets up a hosts file that blocks unwanted connections provided by [stevenblack](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts)
- configures best practice security stuff
