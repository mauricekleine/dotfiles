# dotfiles

This repo contains my dotfiles and it contains an `install.sh` script that:

- installs dev packages (brew, zsh, tmux)
- makes zsh to be the default shell
- copies my actual dotfiles to the right locations
- sets up a hosts file that blocks unwanted connections provided by [stevenblack](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts)
- configures best practice security stuff

For the spaceship theme that is automatically applied to zsh, it's recommended to install a Powerline font, like [Fira Mono](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/FiraMono)
