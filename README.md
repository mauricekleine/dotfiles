# dotfiles

This repo contains my dotfiles and it contains an `install.sh` script that:
- installs dev packages (brewm, zsh, tmux)
- sets zsh to be the default shell
- copies my actual dotfiles to the right locations
- sets up a hosts file that blocks unwanted connections provided by [someonewhocares](https://www.someonewhocares.org/hosts/hosts)
- configures best practice security stuff

For the spaceship theme that is automatically applied to zsh, it's recommended to install a Powerline font like [Fira Mono](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/FiraMono)
